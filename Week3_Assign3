Is there advantages to using a relative URL as opposed to an absolute URL?

Yes and no. With most things in this world there are pros and cons. However, relative URLs do have a rather big stepup above absolute URLs.
This is called portability. Normally Absolute URLs are tied to specific domains and protocols whereas relaitves are not and can be sort of "Relative". 
Furthermore, it makes it easier to migrate or duplicate website to a different domain without having to update elements of the link.



Some advantages of a text editor include:

- Simplicity - Text editors are simple and lightweight. This means they are easy to fire up and get to work. 
They have been optimised as such for these core reasons.

- Speed - Text editors are designed for quick text input and manipulation, 
allowing quick calculations and little delay for projects alike, and while ocding is the primary use, 
they can also be used to simply jot down some notes and be saved as a .txt file.


- Customization - Many text editors are very customizable and quite flexible. 
Users can configure settings, key shortcuts, and themes to match their preferences and workflow. 
This is my personal favorite advanatage to a good IDE or text editor.

While there are so many other advantages, these are my favorite and are 
really the core components of an IDE or text editor
