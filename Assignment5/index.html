    <h1>Republic</h1>
    <h2>Plato</h2>
    
    <p>
        Why do men behave justly? Is it because they fear societal punishment? Are they trembling before notions of divine retribution? 
        Do the stronger elements of society scare the weak into submission in the name of law? 
        Or do men behave justly because it is good for them to do so? Is justice, regardless of its rewards and punishments, 
        a good thing in and of itself? How do we define justice? Plato sets out to answer these questions in The Republic. 
        He wants to define justice, and to define it in such a way as to show that justice is worthwhile in and of itself. 
        He meets these two challenges with a single solution: a definition of justice that appeals to human psychology, 
        rather than to perceived behavior.

        Plato’s strategy in The Republic is to first explicate the primary notion of societal, or political, justice, 
        and then to derive an analogous concept of individual justice. In Books II, III, and IV, 
        Plato identifies political justice as harmony in a structured political body. 
        An ideal society consists of three main classes of people—producers (craftsmen, farmers, artisans, etc.), auxiliaries (warriors), 
        and guardians (rulers); a society is just when relations between these three classes are right. Each group must perform its 
        appropriate function, and only that function, and each must be in the right position of power in relation to the others. 
        Rulers must rule, auxiliaries must uphold rulers’ convictions, and producers must limit themselves to exercising whatever 
        skills nature granted them (farming, blacksmithing, painting, etc.) Justice is a principle of specialization: a principle that requires 
        that each person fulfill the societal role to which nature fitted him and not interfere in any other business.
