Thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder
I was caught in the middle of a railroad track (thunder)
I looked around, and I knew there was no turning back (thunder)
My mind raced, and I thought "What could I do?" (thunder)
And I knew there was no help, no help from you (thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns (yeah)
Tore me apart
You've been thunderstruck
Rolled down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas
And we had some fun
<p>
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
And I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind
You've been thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Ooh, thunderstruck
</p>
Yeah
Well, I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said, "Yeah, it's all right, we're doing fine"
Yeah, it's all right, we're doing fine, so fine
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck (thunderstruck)
Whoa, baby, baby (thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck
