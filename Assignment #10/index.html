    <p>The new Souls-Like phenomenon <strong>Lies of P</strong> is based on the classic tale The Adventures of Pinocchio from 1883 by Italian author Carlo Collodi. Similarities with Collodi’s original novel mostly start and end with Pinocchio being a puppet created by Geppetto While Pinocchio’s nose doesn’t grow like he’s known for, his tendency to lie is still present and directly affects the story. Similar to games like Elden Ring or Bloodborne, Lies of P actually has multiple endings based on the choices the player makes.</p>
